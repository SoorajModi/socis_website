# How to Update

This document outlines how to update parts of the website. See `Contributing.md` to see how to contribute to the repo. 

## Updating the exec/staff list

Open `src/pages/about/components/execList.js`. This file contains the full list of exec and staff including their names,
roles, and description. By editing this file you can update the contents of the site.

To update profile pictures, replace the corresponding images in `src/pages/about/assets`. Make sure the file names match
the imported images in `execList.js`.
